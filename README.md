# SQL-Data-Warehouse-from-Scratch
This project demonstrates the end-to-end design and implementation of a SQL Data Warehouse. Starting from raw, unorganized data, I built a structured analytical environment using industry-standard modeling techniques. The goal was to transform operational data into actionable business intelligence through a scalable Medallion Architecture.
